## Project Overview <a name="project-overview"></a>
This project provides a comprehensive solution for predicting customer churn and generating actionable insights to reduce attrition. The system analyzes customer demographics, service usage patterns, billing information, and contract details to identify high-risk customers before they churn. 

**Key Features:**
- Machine learning model with 82% ROC AUC accuracy
- Automated business insights generation
- Financial impact analysis
- Retention strategy recommendations
- Comprehensive PDF reporting

## Business Problem <a name="business-problem"></a>
In today's competitive telecommunications market, customer retention is critical for sustainable growth. Our analysis reveals:

- **27% churn rate** among customers
- **$3.2M** estimated annual revenue loss from churn
- **Month-to-month** customers are 3x more likely to churn
- New customers (<1 year) have **45% higher churn risk**
- Fiber optic users show **38% churn rate** vs 19% for DSL
